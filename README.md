# Haemorrhoids

Haemorrhoids is an Asteroids clone created as a learning project to explore Pygame and improve Git skills. This medical-themed shooter game puts you in control of a tube of haemorrhoid cream, battling haemorrhoids, a syringe and an angry polyp in a retro-style environment. The game features increasing difficulty levels, a scoring system, and classic space shooter mechanics.

## Features

- Classic Asteroids-style gameplay
- Player ship with thrust and rotation controls
- Destructible haemorrhoids that split into smaller pieces
- Enemies that shoot at the player
- Scoring system and high score tracking
- Multiple lives and respawn mechanics
- Retro sound effects and a dark ambient soundtrack
- Particle effects for explosions

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install Pygame by running:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Slaeg/Haemorrhoids.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Haemorrhoids
   ```

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Use the arrow keys to control your spaceship:
   - Up Arrow: Thrust
   - Left/Right Arrows: Rotate
3. Press the Spacebar to shoot
4. Destroy haemorrhoids and enemys to score points
5. Avoid collisions with haemorrhoids and enemy bullets

## Learning Outcomes

I undertook this project to develop skills in:

- Pygame library usage for game development
- Object-oriented programming in Python
- Game logic implementation (collision detection, spawning objects, etc.)
- Git version control, including branching and merging
